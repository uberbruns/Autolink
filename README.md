## Usage

Select a source and a target folder. Than place hidden files named ".createlink" in any subdirectory of the source folder.
The app will scan for those files and accordingly creates a structure of folders and symlinks.

## Example

Here is an example of a source directory that is mirrored into a dropbox excluding the folder "Internal".

Left: Source Folder, Right: Target Folder
